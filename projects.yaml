      date: "2021-10-01"
      description: |
        A space invaders game written entirely in x86 assembly. This was a bonus project in a team for my Computer Architecture class. We only had access to basic functions to implement 
        the game: prints something on the screen and a timer to control the fps. Because the project was done a group of 3 people, the teachers required us to add "extra" features like sound effects.
        <br/> <br/>
        Adding sound in x86 Assembly was <b>not</b> easy. I have improvised a melody on the piano and they used the frequencies of the notes to play some basic sound track.
        <br/> <br/>
        We had a lot of low level bugs that were difficult to debug but we have managed to complete the project on time. In this project, I learned the importance of persistence, as there were many times 
        when I felt like giving up due to challenging low-level bugs that were difficult to debug

        A multiplayer connect4 game in browser using web sockets and node. Vanilla JS was used because it was a requirement from the university. 
        The game was developed in a team with another colleague. 
        <br/> <br/>
        The UI was first prototyped in Figma and then we implemented it in css using grid and flexbox. The websocket logic was the most difficult part of the project. 
        Because we were not using any JS framework we had to use low level socket browser APIs to send and receive messages. 
        <br/> <br/>
        You can try out the game in the browser as it is available on the Internet <a class="link" href="https://connect4-rseh.onrender.com">here </a>
        (The page might take one minute to load for the first time because I am using a free deployment service). You can open two 
        browser tabs and play with yourself if you do not have someone else to play with.

      description: |
        This project was made as part of a course about Compilers and Execution Environments. The task was to generate assembly code for a given string of c code.
        I implemented parsing, typechecking, AST to IR and IR to assembly. My compiler was able to support all binary operators, loops and conditionals. 
        The compiler was implemented in scala using pattern matching and recursion.
        <br/> <br/> 
        This is probably the <b>most difficult </b> project I have ever made so far. The code base was around 1000 lines of code of complex complier logic. The performance of the generated 
        assembly was far from great. For any expression I would save the values on the stack and only if necessary use registers. This meant that a lot of simple would use stack allocation 
        even though enough registers would be available. Overall it was a very challenging project but very rewarding in the end.

        A <em>Flask</em> based web application with a frontend that features two interactive buttons. When a button is clicked, an event is sent to the backend, 
        which randomly responds with either success or failure. This response, along with the button clicked, should be logged in a UI element on the frontend (a <em>log viewer</em>).
        Importantly, this log is persisted between user sessions.
        <br/> <br/>
        In this project, I mainly focused on making a clean interface with a dark mode toggle and with a responsive design that works well on any device.

        In a smart home, a resident might want to reduce the electrical consumption of their appliances by monitoring their energy usage. This project enables users to set usage limits for "groups" 
        of appliances, and when these limits are exceeded, the highest-consuming appliances are automatically disconnected from the power supply. After some time, the system will try to restart the 
        turned off appliances if the do no exceed the consumption limit.

        <br/> <br/> This was my <b>first</b> project where I have tried to make a UI that actually looks good. I have used Figma to prototype the design and them implemented it in CSS + HTML. In order to have a nicer scroll bar I have implemented one from scratch using vanilla javascript.

      description: "3D game developed in Unity for a gamejam with the theme \"UnexpectedGame\".Because I did not have a team I have joined a team on discord with people that I did not know. I worked with two students from USA and someone else from UK.
                    Because we the gamejam spanned two weeks we had a lot of time to try and prototype many different ideas. Unfortunately, we were too optimistic about our skills and we had to modify the initial idea of the game to something that we could implement in the given time.
                    The idea we implemented is that the player is a mailman that has to deliver mail to the right boxes. The player can throw the mail to deliver it to the matching mail box. To make the game more challenging we added a timer for each level. In higher levels, boxes drop from the \"sky\" that block you from throwing the mail.
                    We have added more crazy ideas such as dynamite for destroying the boxes. You can see the game submission at the url on top. 
                    During this experience I have learned how to communicate in a team and how to be clear about my expectations from the other team members. Unfortunately, half way through the project, one team member was disappointed by the fact that we limit the scope of the game too much and decided to leave the team.
                    However, we handled the situation correctly and we continued the project without any hard feelings.
                    I have also learned how to structure the code better and it was my first project on Github where I would have another contributor apart from myself (haha).
                    It was this project that taught me how to solve merge conflicts, create branches and work with git in a more proficient way.

        2D platformer game developed in Unity for a gamejam over a span of one weekend during university.  This project taught me how to be pragmatic and realistic about what features to implement given the limited time availability. 
        <br/> <br/>
        Even though the time span was short, 
        I managed to implement some game mechanics that I have never implemented before. One of such mechanics is that once you jump on the head of the enemy you can control the enemy player to use him to your advantage.
